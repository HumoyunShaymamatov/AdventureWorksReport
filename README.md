# AdventureWorksReport
This is my Power BI Desktop project to showcase my skills.
In this project I had a hypothetical scenario in which I worked as a Business Analist to the company called AdventureWorks. I had my dataset in csv form, and some png icons for making my navbar icons better.

After getting and transforming the data in Power Query I quickly checked and adjusted the relationships

And these are the measures that I creatid later to use in the report view page.

I then made a tonne of new measures and sometimes columns in data vew page.

I was working for managers so they needed some high level trends and KPIs. this is why in executive page I showed Revenue trending for differeent time frequencies (year, month, quarter, week), overall and monthly Revenue, Orders, Returns, and Total Profit; top products were filtered by total orders. I also showed bar graph for categories which helps interactive filtering even more. Top ordered  and Most returned product types also help to have a general view better.

Because I didn't want to make the graphs too crowded I added additional filters in an offcanvas.

The next page was about map and map filtering which showed our presence in a global market.

I also made Product detail page which users can drill through from top products matrix. As you can see, I showed every metric that could be helpful.

The final page was all about the customers. The unrealisticly informative dataset was helpful to filter my customers by their salaries and occupations. I also made a table to filter out the top customers and show how many products they bought, and how much revenue they brought. I found A glitch there in one specific part of the filters and I couldn't remove it yet. To inform the users I added a button (Bookmark) to show what happens.

I also made a custom Tooltip for my executive page which is all about trends and KPIs and used in category chart.

As you may see I colorcoded many metrics (black = good/not bad, red = bad) to make it easier for users to visualize the dataset better.
